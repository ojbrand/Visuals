# Project README

## Explore the Full Workbooks, Not Just PDFs!

Welcome to my GitHub repository! A quick but important reminder:

This project is contains many interactive visuals  (e.g. Tableau, Jupyter), which contain the core analysis and interactive features. While PDFs are provided for quick reference, they do not showcase the full capabilities and insights of the full workbooks.

### Benefits of a full workbook
- **Interactive Features**: Workbooks include dynamic elements like filters, interactive visuals, and detailed data exploration options.
- **Comprehensive Context**: Many findings are best understood when engaging directly with the workbooks.
- **Clarity in Visualizations**: Static PDFs may miss the nuances and interactivity designed into the original files.

### Steps to Access the Workbooks
1. Download the workbook files to your local machine.
2. Tableau will already include the data in the workbook, but for .py and .ipynb files please make sure to download all files
3. Use the appropriate software to view them:
   - **Tableau Files**: Open with Tableau Desktop.
   - **Excel Files**: Use Microsoft Excel or a compatible program.
   - **Jupyter Notebooks**: Run in Jupyter Lab or Notebook environments.
