## Explore the Full Workbooks, Not Just PDFs!

Welcome to my GitHub repository! A quick but important reminder:

This repository does not just contain static, but interactive visuals as well, which contain core analysis and interactive features. While PDFs are provided for quick reference, they do not showcase the full capabilities and insights available.

Many of these are also taken from assignments, so there may be code unrelated to the visuals being created or lines that are taken out of context. These visuals are to demonstrate what I am capable of, I hope you enjoy what I have to show

### Benefits of a full workbook
- **Interactive Features**: Workbooks include dynamic elements like filters, interactive visuals, and detailed data exploration options.
- **Comprehensive Context**: Many findings are best understood when engaging directly with the workbooks.
- **Clarity in Visualizations**: Static PDFs may miss the nuances and interactivity designed into the original files.

### Steps to Access the Workbooks
1. Download the files to your local machine.
2. Tableau will already include the data in the workbook, but for .py and .ipynb files please make sure to download all files
3. Use the appropriate software to view them:
   - **Tableau Files**: Open with Tableau Desktop.
   - **.py files**: Use VS code or another IDE.
   - **.ipynb files**: Use VS code or another IDE.
